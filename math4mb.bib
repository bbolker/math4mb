	abstract = {Question: Population ecology and population genetics are treated separately in most textbooks. However, Darwin’s term the ‘struggle for existence’ included both natural selection and ecological competition. Using the simplest possible mathematical models, this paper searches for historical reasons for the lack of unity in ecological and evolutionary thought. Assumptions and methods: Logistic density-dependent population growth and Lotka-Volterra competition models are used throughout. Derivations of the logistic from first principles of resource use, competition for space, and births and deaths of individuals are documented. A full range of possible kinds of natural selection, including constant selection, density- and frequency-dependent selection, as well as hard and soft selection, can emerge cleanly as natural outcomes from the simplest-imaginable haploid models derived from Lotka-Volterra competition. Extensions to incorporate more realism, including non-linear per capita density dependence, Allee effects, complex life histories, discrete generations, diploid Mendelian genetics, sexual populations, and speciation are briefly discussed. Conclusions: Widespread use of r-K (‘carrying capacity’) models of population growth appears to have catalysed fundamental discords in ecology, and between ecology and evolution. Verhulst’s original polynomial form of the logistic, here termed the r-α model, is both more natural in theory, and accords better with empirical data. The r-α formulation explains apparent paradoxes involving the r-K logistic, including controversial aspects of r- and K-selection. Adoption of first-principles birth–death or r-α modelling clarifies natural selection in density-regulated populations, and leads to an improved understanding of Darwinian evolution and speciation.},

	abstract = {Many studies have analysed how variability in reproductive success affects fitness. However, each study tends to focus on a particular problem, leaving unclear the overall structure of variability in populations. This fractured conceptual framework often causes particular applications to be incomplete or improperly analysed. In this article, I present a concise introduction to the two key aspects of the theory. First, all measures of fitness ultimately arise from the relative comparison of the reproductive success of individuals or genotypes with the average reproductive success in the population. That relative measure creates a diminishing relation between reproductive success and fitness. Diminishing returns reduce fitness in proportion to variability in reproductive success. The relative measurement of success also induces a frequency dependence that favours rare types. Second, variability in populations has a hierarchical structure. Variable success in different traits of an individual affects that individual's variation in reproduction. Correlation between different individuals’ reproduction affects variation in the aggregate success of particular alleles across the population. One must consider the hierarchical structure of variability in relation to different consequences of temporal, spatial and developmental variability. Although a complete analysis of variability has many separate parts, this simple framework allows one to see the structure of the whole and to place particular problems in their proper relation to the general theory. The biological understanding of relative success and the hierarchical structure of variability in populations may also contribute to a deeper economic theory of returns under uncertainty.},

However, often ignored complexities have generated confusion around use of the metric. This is particularly apparent with the emergent pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We address some misconceptions about the predictive ability of the reproductive number, focusing on how it changes over time, varies over space, and relates to epidemic size by referencing the mathematical definition of R and examples from the current pandemic. We hope that a better appreciation of the uses, nuances, and limitations of R and R0 facilitates a better understanding of epidemic spread, epidemic severity, and the effects of interventions in the context of SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {An epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number R). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the eﬀectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of “test-and-treat” interventions against the human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.},

Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector–host models and can be applied to more complex models.

R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size, but estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated directly from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval – the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r–R relationship and provide robust estimates of R.},

The analysis in each case involves determination of equilibria and determining the asymptotic stability of each equilibrium by linearization about the equilibrium. In each of the cases studied in the preceding chapter the disease-free equilibrium was asymptotically stable if and only if 0<R0<1 and if R0>1 there was a unique endemic equilibrium that was asymptotically stable. In this chapter, we will see that these properties continue to hold for many more general models, but there are situations in which there may be an asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium when 0<1R0<1, and other situations in which there is an endemic equilibrium that is unstable for some values of R0>1.},

Each edge (u,v) in the graph is equipped with two weights W(u,v) and W(v,u) that represent the (subjective) strength of the connection and determine the probability that u infects v in case u is infected and vice versa. Expressions for the epidemic threshold are derived for i.i.d. weights and for weights that are functions of the degrees. For i.i.d. weights, a variation of the so called acquaintance vaccination strategy is analyzed where vertices are chosen randomly and neighbors of these vertices with large edge weights are vaccinated. This strategy is shown to outperform the strategy where the neighbors are chosen randomly in the sense that the basic reproduction number is smaller for a given vaccination coverage.},

	abstract = {Wade Hampton Frost was the first Professor of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University in the first Department of Epidemiology in the United States. A Virginian and a graduate of the University of Virginia, Frost began his remarkable career with two decades of service in the United States Public Health Service. He investigated epidemics of yellow fever, typhoid, polio, streptococcal sore throat, meningitis, and influenza. His greatest contributions during this part of his career were the recognition that mild and asymptomatic childhood polio produced life-long immunity and the development of methods for tracking influenza epidemics. He was recruited to Johns Hopkins in 1919, where, as a Professor at the School of Hygiene and Public Health, he trained many of the future leaders of American public health programs. He made substantial contributions to epidemiologic methodology including developing the concept of an index case during investigations of tuberculosis in Tennessee, the use of life-table methods for estimating secondary attack rates, the use of age cohorts for longitudinal studies, and, in collaboration with Lowell Reed, the first mathematical expression of the epidemic curve. Thomas M. Daniel's biography tells the story of Frost's life and work. Drawing of Frost's personal papers and recorded interviews with his colleagues deposited in the Frost Archives at the University of Virginia Medical Center as well as material from the Fauquier County Heritage Society and Johns Hopkins University, Daniel recounts the story of Frost's life and provides many insights into the personal characteristics of his subject. Daniel also reviews Frost's work, examining his published papers and archived teaching notes to elucidate the scope of and manner in which Frost made his seminal contributions to epidemiology and public health.

	abstract = {Mathematical Models in Biology began as a set of lecture notes for a course taught at Brown University. It has since evolved through several years of classroom testing at Brown and Duke Universities. The task of setting down words on paper became a cherished hobby that kept the long process of shaping and reshaping the various manuscripts from becoming an arduous job. My aim has been to present instances of interaction between two major disciplines, biology and mathematics. The goal has been that of addressing a fairly wide audience. It is my hope that students of biology will find this text useful as a summary of modern mathematical methods currently used in modelling, and furthermore, that students of applied mathematics might benefit from examples of applications of mathematics to real-life problems. As little background as possible (both in mathematics and in biology) has been assumed throughout the book: prerequisites are basic calculus so that undergraduate students, as well as beginning graduate students, will find most of the material accessible. Other background mathematics such as topics from linear algebra and ordinary differential equations are given in full detail herein as the need arises. Students familiar with this material can advance at a more rapid pace through the book. There is far more material here than can be taught in a single semester. This leaves some room for personal taste on the part of the instructor as to what to cover. (See table for several suggestions.) While necessitating selectivity in class, the length of the book is intended to encourage independent student reading and exploration of material not formally taught. References to additional sources are included where possible so that the text may be used as a reference source for the more advanced reader. Features of this book are outlined below. Organization: Models discussed fall into three broad categories: discrete, continuous, and spatially distributed (forming respectively Parts I, II, and III in the text). The first describes populations that reproduce at fixed intervals; the second pertains to processes that may be viewed as continuous in time; the last treats systems for which distribution over space is an important feature. Approach: (1) Concepts basic in modelling are introduced in the early chapters and reappear throughout later material. For example steady states, stability, and parameter variations are first encountered within the context of difference equations and reemerge in models based on ordinary and partial differential equations.},

Tolkien (1954) The Lord of the Rings, Part 1 Ballantine Books, NY (1965) Periodicity is an inherent phenomenon in living things. From the cell cycle, which governs the rate and timing of mitosis (cell division), to the diurnal (circadian) cycle that results in sleep-wake patterns, to the ebb and flow of populations in their natural environment—life proceeds in a rhythmic and periodic style. The stability of these periodic phenomena, the fact that they are not easily disrupted or changed by a noisy and random environment, leads us to believe that the pattern is a ubiquitous part of the process of growth, of biochemical and metabolic control systems, and of population fluctuations. Oscillations are easily found in such physical examples as spring-mass systems and electrical circuits, which ideally are linear in behavior. Nonlinear equations such as the Lotka-Volterra predation model yield oscillations too. However, as previously suggested, the Lotka-Volterra equations are not sufficiently descriptive of the oscillations encountered in natural population cycles. For one thing, the Lotka-Volterra cycles are neutrally stable. This means that the amplitude of oscillations depends on the initial population level. (We shall see in Section 8.8 that all conservative systems share this property.) Another unrealistic feature is that the Lotka-Volterra model is structurally unstable: very slight modifications of the equations will disrupt the cycling behavior (see comments in Chapter 6). For this combination of reasons, we are led to consider more suitable descriptions of the stable biological cycles.},

The analysis is focused on the transition between the two chaotic phases displayed by the model: one dominated by spiking dynamics and the other by bursts. At the transition an abrupt shrinking of the attractor size associated with a sharp peak in the maximal Lyapunov exponent is observable. However, the transition appears to be continuous and smoothed out over a finite current interval, where bursts and spikes coexist. The beginning of the transition (from the bursting side) is signaled from a structural modification in the interspike interval return map. This change in the map shape is associated with the disappearance of the family of solutions responsible for the onset of the bursting chaos. The successive passage from bursting to spiking chaos is associated with a progressive pruning of unstable long-lasting bursts.},

	abstract = {The population dynamics of infectious diseases occasionally undergo rapid qualitative changes, such as transitions from annual to biennial cycles or to irregular dynamics. Previous work, based on the standard seasonally forced ‘susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed’ (SEIR) model has found that transitions in the dynamics of many childhood diseases result from bifurcations induced by slow changes in birth and vaccination rates. However, the standard SEIR formulation assumes that the stage durations (latent and infectious periods) are exponentially distributed, whereas real distributions are narrower and centred around the mean. Much recent work has indicated that realistically distributed stage durations strongly affect the dynamical structure of seasonally forced epidemic models. We investigate whether inferences drawn from previous analyses of transitions in patterns of measles dynamics are robust to the shapes of the stage duration distributions. As an illustrative example, we analyse measles dynamics in New York City from 1928 to 1972. We find that with a fixed mean infectious period in the susceptible–infectious–removed (SIR) model, the dynamical structure and predicted transitions vary substantially as a function of the shape of the infectious period distribution. By contrast, with fixed mean latent and infectious periods in the SEIR model, the shapes of the stage duration distributions have a less dramatic effect on model dynamical structure and predicted transitions. All these results can be understood more easily by considering the distribution of the disease generation time as opposed to the distributions of individual disease stages. Numerical bifurcation analysis reveals that for a given mean generation time the dynamics of the SIR and SEIR models for measles are nearly equivalent and are insensitive to the shapes of the disease stage distributions.},

	abstract = {Computational properties of use of biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

	isbn = {978-0-87893-702-8},
	shorttitle = {Evolutionary {Theory}},
	abstract = {Evolutionary Theory is for graduate students, researchers, and advanced undergraduates who want an understanding of the mathematical and biological reasoning that underlies evolutionary theory. The book covers all of the major theoretical approaches used to study the mechanics of evolution, including classical one- and two-locus models, diffusion theory, coalescent theory, quantitative genetics, and game theory. There are also chapters on theoretical approaches to the evolution of development and on multilevel selection theory. Each subject is illustrated by focusing on those results that have the greatest power to influence the way that we think about how evolution works. These major results are developed in detail, with many accompanying illustrations, showing exactly how they are derived and how the mathematics relates to the biological insights that they yield. In this way, the reader learns something of the actual machinery of different branches of theory while gaining a deeper understanding of the evolutionary process.Roughly half of the book focuses on gene-based models, the other half being concerned with general phenotype-based theory. Throughout, emphasis is placed on the fundamental relationships between the different branches of theory, illustrating how all of these branches are united by a few basic, universal, principles.The only mathematical background assumed is basic calculus. More advanced mathematical methods are explained, with the help of an extensive appendix, when they are needed.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-28884-2},
	abstract = {In this 1982 book, the theory of games, first developed to analyse economic behaviour, is modified so that it can be applied to evolving populations. John Maynard Smith's concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy is relevant whenever the best thing for an animal or plant to do depends on what others are doing. The theory leads to testable predictions about the evolution of behaviour, of sex and genetic systems, and of growth and life history patterns. This book contains a full account of the theory, and of the data relevant to it. The account is aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, teachers and research workers in animal behaviour, population genetics and evolutionary biology. The book will also be of interest to mathematicians and game theorists; the mathematics has been largely confined to appendixes so that the main text may be easily followed by biologists.},

Hamilton, widely acknowledged as the most important theoretical biologist of the 20th century. His papers continue to exert an enormous influence and they are now being republished for the first time. This first volume contains all of Hamilton's publications prior to 1981, a set especially relevant to social behavior, kinship theory, sociobiology, and the notion of `selfish genes'. Each paper is introduced by an autobiographical essay written especially for this collection. Accessible to non-specialists, this fascinating volume features several of the most read and famous papers of modern biology.},
