The development of statistical methods at Rothamsted Experimental Station by Sir Ronald Fisher is used to illustrate these themes.},

	url = {https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/30212075},
	abstract = {Question: Population ecology and population genetics are treated separately in most textbooks. However, Darwin’s term the ‘struggle for existence’ included both natural selection and ecological competition. Using the simplest possible mathematical models, this paper searches for historical reasons for the lack of unity in ecological and evolutionary thought. Assumptions and methods: Logistic density-dependent population growth and Lotka-Volterra competition models are used throughout. Derivations of the logistic from first principles of resource use, competition for space, and births and deaths of individuals are documented. A full range of possible kinds of natural selection, including constant selection, density- and frequency-dependent selection, as well as hard and soft selection, can emerge cleanly as natural outcomes from the simplest-imaginable haploid models derived from Lotka-Volterra competition. Extensions to incorporate more realism, including non-linear per capita density dependence, Allee effects, complex life histories, discrete generations, diploid Mendelian genetics, sexual populations, and speciation are briefly discussed. Conclusions: Widespread use of r-K (‘carrying capacity’) models of population growth appears to have catalysed fundamental discords in ecology, and between ecology and evolution. Verhulst’s original polynomial form of the logistic, here termed the r-α model, is both more natural in theory, and accords better with empirical data. The r-α formulation explains apparent paradoxes involving the r-K logistic, including controversial aspects of r- and K-selection. Adoption of first-principles birth–death or r-α modelling clarifies natural selection in density-regulated populations, and leads to an improved understanding of Darwinian evolution and speciation.},

	abstract = {Many studies have analysed how variability in reproductive success affects fitness. However, each study tends to focus on a particular problem, leaving unclear the overall structure of variability in populations. This fractured conceptual framework often causes particular applications to be incomplete or improperly analysed. In this article, I present a concise introduction to the two key aspects of the theory. First, all measures of fitness ultimately arise from the relative comparison of the reproductive success of individuals or genotypes with the average reproductive success in the population. That relative measure creates a diminishing relation between reproductive success and fitness. Diminishing returns reduce fitness in proportion to variability in reproductive success. The relative measurement of success also induces a frequency dependence that favours rare types. Second, variability in populations has a hierarchical structure. Variable success in different traits of an individual affects that individual's variation in reproduction. Correlation between different individuals’ reproduction affects variation in the aggregate success of particular alleles across the population. One must consider the hierarchical structure of variability in relation to different consequences of temporal, spatial and developmental variability. Although a complete analysis of variability has many separate parts, this simple framework allows one to see the structure of the whole and to place particular problems in their proper relation to the general theory. The biological understanding of relative success and the hierarchical structure of variability in populations may also contribute to a deeper economic theory of returns under uncertainty.},
