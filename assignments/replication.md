title: "Replication exercise"
---

In this part of the project you will replicate, as completely as practical, a paper from the literature. The goal is to learn something about the nuts and bolts, and possibly to find steps that are left out.

You are not necessarily required to replicate every single element of the paper. How far you get will depend on (1) how hard the replication is (e.g. whether it contains novel mathematical topics, or extensive simulation); (2) how interested you are in investing effort in the replication vs. extending the paper in different directions or trying something novel. Your complete final assignment must contain at least some component of replication and some of novel modeling, but the balance is up to you.

## Milestones

- Fri 26 March: progress report (source code, PDF, + individual contribution repots)

## Mathematical components

* work through the derivations yourself. Don't bother to rewrite them all in LaTeX (this would be a waste of time), but if there are any transitions left out in the paper, write each of them up as a separate component of your replication. Comment on any steps in the derivations that you found interesting, or tricky, or that required you to learn something new.

## Computational components

* replicate all figures (as closely as reasonably possible)
* replicate all numerical values quoted in the text
* for stochastic elements (e.g. results of stochastic simulations), you should aim for results that are *qualitatively* similar (e.g. if a single replication is shown).  If summaries of ensembles are given (e.g. standard deviations or envelopes of simulation curves) you should expect to get pretty close.

## Data-related components, e.g. parameter fitting

* If full data are provided, you should be able to match (or nearly match) the results of any estimation procedures.
* If data are *not* provided, it may be possible to scrape them from the figures, or to find a similar data set: discuss this with me.
