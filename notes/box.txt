Mathematistry is characterized by development of theory for theory's sake, which since it seldom touches down with practice, has a tendency to redefine the problem rather than solve it. Typically, there has once been a statistical problem with scientific relevance but this has long since been lost sight of.

The penalty for scientific irrelevance is, of course, that the statistician's work is ignored by the scientific community. But this does not come to the notice of a statistician who has no contact with that community. It is sometimes alleged that there is no actual harm in mathematistry. A group of people can be kept quite happy, playing with a problem that may once have had relevance and proposing solutions never to be exposed to the dangerous test of usefulness. They enjoy reading papers to each other at meetings and they are usually quite inoffensive. But we must surely regret that valuable talents are wasted at a period in history when they could be put to good use.

Furthermore, there is unhappy evidence that mathematistry is not harmless. In such areas as sociology, psychology, education, and even, I sadly say, engineering, investigators who are not themselves statisticians sometimes take mathematistry seriously. Overawed by what they do not understand, they mistakenly distrust their own common sense and adopt inappropriate procedures devised by mathematicians with no scientific experience.
